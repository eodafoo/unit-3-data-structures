# Data Structures

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will be creating data structures that are commonly use in software engineering. Understanding data structures allows engineers to store their data in optimal formats. A description of each data structure is provided in the [Summary](#summary). Feel free to look online for additional information about each structure. NOTE: This challenge intentionally avoids using ES6 classes in order to develop a deeper understanding of the prototype chain.

Learning goals

- Understand [pseudoclassical inheritance pattern](https://medium.com/@jasondotlee/the-pseudoclassical-inheritance-pattern-in-javascript-e12e56d441aa)
- Understand the use case of data structures provided in challenges
- Be able to reimplement data structures provided in challenges

## Summary

### [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))
<img src="./docs/assets/images/stack.png" height="200px"><br>
A data structure that serves as a collection of elements, with two principle operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the collection. Pop removes the last element that was added. This data structure follows the "Last In, First Out" principle (LIFO), where the elements that were most recently pushed (added) to the stack, are popped off (removed) first.

Think of a stack of pancakes - you add pancakes to the top of the stack and eat them from top to bottom.

### [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))
<img src="./docs/assets/images/queue.png" height="200px"><br>
A data structure that serves as a collection of elements that preserves the order at which the elements are inserted. The principle operations are enqueue, which adds an element to the collection, and dequeue, which removes the element that was added the earliest. This data structure follows the "First In, First Out" principle (FIFO), where elements that are enqueued (added) into the queue first, are dequeue (removed) first.

Think of a line for a roller coaster - the people that enter the line first, are the ones that get on the ride first.

### [LinkedList](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
<img src="./docs/assets/images/linked_list.png" height="200px"><br>
A data structure that serves as a collection of elements. Data is stored in nodes, and each node has a reference to the next node. In order to access elements from a linked list, the first node (or head) is checked. If the element is not present in the first node, then the node that is referenced by the head (the second node) is checked. This action is repeated until the entire list is inspected. The two principle operations are push (or add) and contains. Push creates a new node and adds
it to the end of the list. Contains checks the entire list and determines if the element is present in any of the nodes.

### [Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)
<img src="./docs/assets/images/hash_table.png" height="200px"><br>
A data structure that stores key-value pairs (similar to the way an object works in javascript). The location in memory where the element is stored is determined by running the key through a hash function. The hash function accepts a key and returns an address where the element should be inserted/retrieved.

A common problem occurs when two distinct keys are converted to the same address - an occurrence called a collision. Collisions need to be handled in a way that ensures no data is overwritten and all data can still be efficiently retrieved.

### [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)
<img src="./docs/assets/images/binary.png" height="200px"><br>
Similar to a tree, except with a few constraints:

* each node can only have up to 2 children

* the left child must have a smaller value than its parent

* the right child must have a greater value than its parent

### [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type))
<img src="./docs/assets/images/set.png" height="200px"><br>
A data structure that specializes in determining if an object is present in a collection or not. The two principle operations are add, which adds an element to the set, and contains, which determines if an element is present in the set. Elements present in the set are distinct, and adding duplicate elements does not increase the size of the set.

### [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
<img src="./docs/assets/images/tree.png" height="200px"><br>
A data structure that stores elements in a hierarchical manner (an example would be if you were storing a family tree). Each element is stored in a node, and each node has a references to its children (the nodes below that node). Each node can only have one parent.

### [Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type))
<img src="./docs/assets/images/graph.gif" height="200px"><br>
A collection of nodes that have references to other nodes.

A good use case of a graph would be to store data of people in a social network. Each node not only contains data about an person, but also a reference to another person. Retrieving a person's friends would only involve looking at one node's references to other nodes.

### [Doubly LinkedList](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list)
<img src="./docs/assets/images/doubly_linked.PNG" height="200px"><br>
Similar to a linked list with the addition that each node also has reference to the previous node.

## How do I get started?
1. Have __BOTH__ partners fork this repo
    - click on the __Fork__ button on the top right of the page
  <br><img src="./docs/assets/images/fork_button.jpg" width="300px"></img>  
    - click on your handle to fork to your repo

2. Each partner clones their own newly forked repo to their local machine
    - first, make sure you're on your new forked repo on GitHub
    - copy and paste GitHub url from the right side of the page
<br><img src="./docs/assets/images/clone-repo-clone-url-button-new.png" width="200px"></img>
    - enter the following line into your command line and insert your copied url instead of the quoted text:
      ```
      git clone 'copied url'
      ```
3. Each partner adds two remote links to their cloned repo on their own local workstation: one to CodesmithLLC's repo, and one to the partner's repo:
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodesmithLLC/unit-3-data-structures.git
    ```
    ```
    git remote add partner https://github.com/PARTNERS_GITHUB_HANDLE/unit-3-data-structures.git
    ```
    \* Make sure to edit the remote partner link with your partner's GitHub handle.
4. As you work remotely on your own workstation, periodically push your changes to your repo with `git push origin main`. Your partner can then use `git pull partner main` to get the changes onto their machine, followed by `git push origin main` to push those changes to their own GitHub repo!

Check out the [GitHub Documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for a more in-depth explanation of forking and cloning.

If working remotely, you'll want to make sure you have the VS Code extension [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) installed. When working with your partner, one of you will need to share your copy of the unit via Live Share - this will allow you to both work together in the same VS Code editor. Note that when using Live Share, it will still be important for *both* partners to fork the challenge, and whoever is sharing should still regularly push changes to their repo. This will ensure that both of you consistently have access to the most recent version of your work.

## Challenges

  - [ ] Implement the ```.add``` method, which adds an element to the set (does not add an object if the object is already present in set)
  - [ ] Implement the ```.contains``` method, which determines if an element in present in a set
  - [ ] Implement the ```.remove``` method, which removes an element from the set if present

- Tree
  - [ ] Implement the ```.add``` method, which adds a value to the tree
  - [ ] Implement the ```.contains``` method, which determines if a value is contained in the list

- Graph
  - [ ] Implement the ```.addNode``` method, which adds a node to the current node
  - [ ] Implement the ```.contains``` method, which determines if a value is contained in a graph
  - [ ] Implement the ```.remove``` method, which removes all nodes with that value

- LinkedList (addToHead method)
  - [ ] Implement the ```.addToHead``` method, which adds an element to the beginning of the list

## How do I test if my answer is correct?
* To test your functions, open index.html in your browser

* You may notice that some tests do not pass unless additional methods are defined and working first. Good unit testing (i.e. testing one function independently) does not require other functions to be defined and working in order to pass. However, it is necessary to bend this rule for this challenge since there are certain assumptions we cannot make about how you choose to design your data structures.

* While completing the challenges, if all tests that previously passed ALL suddenly fail, there is most likely a syntax error in your code. Open Chrome Dev Tool's to locate the cause of the error.

* **Pending tests.** Some of the bonus tests (highlighted blue) are considered "pending" and will not run. In order to enable them, go into the test file and remove the 'x' from in front of the `describe` or `it` function for the corresponding tests.
